    <h2>Roasted Turkey Perfect for Thanksgiving!</h2>
    <p>
      The holiday season means it's <strong><em>Turkey Time</em></strong
      >. I could never figure out why so many people wanted to come over...until
      they confessed it was my recipe for turkey! Gobble, Gobble! I do not stuff
      the turkey. I make my own stuffing on the side and serve in a festive
      dish.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
      <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground thyme</li>
      <li>1 cup honey</li>
      <li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried sage leaves</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cooking Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Rinse the turkey, and pat
        thoroughly dry with paper towels. Brush the turkey with olive oil,
        inside and out.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Mix 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and the thyme in a small
        bowl, and sprinkle the turkey with the mixture.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Place the turkey on a rack set in a roasting pan, and roast in the
        preheated oven for 2 hours.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        In a bowl, stir together the honey, melted butter, sage, parsley, basil,
        1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper, until the mixture is smooth and
        well blended. Brush the turkey with the honey glaze, and return to the
        oven.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Roast the turkey until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run
        clear, about 2 more hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
        thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82
        degrees C). Continue to brush the turkey with the honey glaze frequently
        as it roasts. Remove the turkey from the oven, cover with a doubled
        sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area 10 to 15
        minutes before slicing.
