    <h2>Southern Mac & Cheese Straight From Grandma!</h2>
    <p>
      This is my grandmother's macaroni and cheese recipe that we all crave and
      only get to have twice a year, if we play our cards right. Fairly simple
      and straightforward. The key is cooking time more than anything.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>4 pounds Cheddar cheese, sliced</li>
      <li>1â€‰1/2 cups milk</li>
      <li>5 eggs, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon yellow mustard</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cooking Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni
        in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the
        bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Layer some of the macaroni in a 5-quart baking dish; top with a layer of
        Cheddar cheese. Continue layering macaroni and Cheddar cheese into the
        dish, ending with a Cheddar cheese layer.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Beat milk, eggs, and mustard together in a bowl; pour over macaroni
        mixture, ensuring milk mixture gets to all of the macaroni.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and just before cheese
        around the sides gets crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Season with black pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
